       <span class ="flex-itemcentral1"> ABOUT US</span>
       <span class ="flex-itemcentral2">BASED IN THE HEART OF           GALWAY CITY</span>
       <span class ="flex-itemcentral3"> A long alley in the yard, a few flowers, a coffee table, a borrowed coffee<br> machine and two chairs under the inscription Jungle Cafe. That’s how we <br>started in April 2012. I, Daniel, aimed to start a business where people will<br> meet, taste original dishes, drink quality and fragrant coffee, and above all,<br> where they will feel good. <br><br>

     I relied on my 20-year year experience as a qualified chef, a passion for<br> coffee, and perhaps, empathy and love for good people. From my travels<br> in South America, I found my desire to be surrounded by nature, flowers<br> and plants, and wanted to put this desire into a cafe, and that’s how the<br> jungle cafe was born.  <br><br>

     Jungle Cafe is proud and fortunate to have a team from all over the<br> world. Team members with an open heart, and who agreed with my vision<br> of a “good business”, enabling us to enrich each other – both humanly <br>and professionally. The team, who I am so grateful for, share the same<br> values as me, and that has helped us build the quality and reputation of<br> our cafe.<br><br>

     Thanks to our team, you can feel the power, taste and aroma of<br> espresso with perfectly whipped milk, taste the excellent and healthy <br>flavours, and enjoy the relaxed and informal environment of Jungle Cafe.</span>
